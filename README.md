# DOI-IT-Spending

This is a prototype dashboard that I came up with after three days of playing around with Plotly's Dash framework. The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Dash and learn how to build a dashboard with several componenets. This is certainly not a production-ready dashboard, but was a useful project for learning how to use Dash. I hosted this app on the free tier of Heroku, and it can be viewed here: https://doi-spending.herokuapp.com
